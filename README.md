# Regression Assignment

## Overview
This project contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Assignment_Regression.ipynb`) that focuses on regression analysis. The notebook explores various regression techniques to analyze and predict outcomes based on given datasets. Through this assignment, users will gain hands-on experience with different regression models, evaluating their performance and interpreting results effectively.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Implementation of Regression Models
- Model Evaluation and Performance Metrics
- Visualization of Results

## Activities and Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning (handling missing values, removing outliers)
- Data Transformation (normalization, feature scaling)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (correlation analysis, data visualization)
- Regression Techniques (Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge, Lasso)
- Model Evaluation Metrics (Mean Squared Error, RÂ² Score, Residual Analysis)
- Data Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Dependencies
To run this notebook, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook using:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Assignment_Regression.ipynb
   ```
2. Execute the cells in order to preprocess the data, build regression models, and evaluate their performance.

## Expected Output
The notebook will generate:
- Summary statistics of the dataset
- Graphs and plots for data visualization
- Regression model outputs and performance metrics

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive introduction to regression analysis, helping users understand and apply various regression models in real-world scenarios. By completing this assignment, users will enhance their data science skills and improve their ability to interpret regression results effectively.
