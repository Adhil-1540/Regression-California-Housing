# Regression Assignment

## Overview

This project includes a Jupyter Notebook (`Regression.ipynb`) that focuses on regression analysis using the **California Housing dataset from scikit-learn**. The notebook explores various regression techniques to analyze and predict house prices based on different features. Through this assignment, users will gain hands-on experience with different regression models, evaluating their performance and interpreting results effectively.

## Features

- Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Implementation of Regression Models
- Model Evaluation and Performance Metrics
- Visualization of Results

## Activities and Techniques Used

- Data Cleaning (handling missing values, removing outliers)
- Data Transformation (normalization, feature scaling)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (correlation analysis, data visualization)
- Regression Techniques (Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge, Lasso)
- Model Evaluation Metrics (Mean Squared Error, RÂ² Score, Residual Analysis)
- Data Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Dependencies

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## How to Run

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook using:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Regression.ipynb
   ```
2. Execute the cells in order to preprocess the data, build regression models, and evaluate their performance.

## Dataset Used

- **California Housing dataset from scikit-learn**: This dataset contains various features related to housing in California, such as median income, house age, and total rooms. It is used to predict median house prices.

## Expected Output

The notebook will generate:

- Summary statistics of the dataset
- Graphs and plots for data visualization
- Regression model outputs and performance metrics

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive introduction to regression analysis, helping users understand and apply various regression models in real-world scenarios. By completing this assignment, users will enhance their data science skills and improve their ability to interpret regression results effectively.
